def add_XYZ(XYZ: tuple[str, int, str, str, str, str], character_classes: list[int] = None):
	"""
	Add the XYZ spell into the Spell table and associate each XYZ
	spell with every character class unless provided a list to specify.
	Tuple representing XYZ should be in format:

	(<XYZ_name>, <XYZ_rank>, <duration>, <range>, <components>, <description>)

	XYZ_name: str, in title case.
	XYZ_rank: int representing XYZ rank (1-9 typically)
	duration: str, with the time being abbreviated (Min./Hr.). Typically last 1 Hr.
	range: str, with the distance being abbreviated (Ft./Mi.). Can also be "Line of Sight".
	components: str, typically "V, S, M (2 level <rank> spell slots and <rank> sorcery points)".
				Can also specify "May also use a pre-existing <XYZ or spell_name> and n 
				sorcery points" if you can overlay from an existing spell into this XYZ.
				Example: "V, S, M (2 level 4 spell slots and 4 sorcery points. May also
						  also use a pre-existing 'Sparks' XYZ spell and 2 sorcery points)"
	description: str, typically in format of continuous effect, then the effect that occurs
				 when you detach a material.

	Parameters
	----------
	XYZ: tuple[str, int, str, str, str, str]
		XYZ data to be inserted into the database.
